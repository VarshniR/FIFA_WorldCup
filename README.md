# FIFA_WorldCup ⚽️

##### I have always been a huge fan of Soccer. Growing up I always watched games with my eldest brother and it was really something for us to bond. 
We watched many games together, to the point where we went to watch live games! That was a dream come true!

While I have been practicing SQL and Tableau for a while now, it's been difficult for me to pick a project that I am very passionate about. 
But then I was thinking about the FIFA World CUp that is about to start and had the idea to work on a project that I could add to my portfolio. 

Now, is probably the time to cofess that Argentina is my favorite team 🇦🇷🇦🇷🇦🇷 
And for those that may think that it's because of the GOAT Messi, no that's not the case. 
I do think he deserves to win the World Cup, but even if he doesn't, he will forever be remembered as the GOAT!

I found a FIFA World Cup dataset on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abecklas/fifa-world-cup.

The dataset cointains data from every World Cup that has been played between the period 1930 - 2014. 

Here are some of the questions that I tried to answer by using SQL:

⚽️ Which team won the most World Cups, and which years were the wins?

⚽️ Which Final or Semi-final games were decided by penalties?

⚽️ Which years had the highest and lowest attendance to the World Cup games?

⚽️ What's the average number of goals scored per World Cup?
